## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.
  In Tetris, the goal of the game is to arrange random falling shapes to create a line and score points. There are seven different shapes in Tetris, the I shape which is a straight line of 4 blocks, the O shape which is a 2x2 square, the T shape is an upside down T with the middle line only being two blocks tall. The S and Z shapes are both the same shape just inverted, the shape looks like an s and z being four blocks wide and two blocks tall. The L and J shapes are similair in that they are the same shape just inverted. The L shape is three blocks tall and two blocks wide and the J shape is the invert. 
  The blocks fall from the top of the screen and a rate deteremined by the length of the game. The player needs to move the shape around the play area and place the block in a desired location. When a full horizontal line is made with the shapes, the line is cleared and the player is rewarded points. The more lines removed at a time reward more points. When the player gets the highest amount of lines cleared at one time, four, the player gets a Tetris rewarding bonus points. The player can achieve this by filling four rows leaving room for the I piece to in and remove the lines. 
  The player can rotate the pieces as they fall and speed the pieces fall to speed up the game.
